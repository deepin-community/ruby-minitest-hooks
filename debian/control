Description: Around and before_all/after_all/around_all hooks for Minitest
 minitest-hooks adds around and before_all/after_all/around_all hooks for
 Minitest. This allows you do things like run each suite of specs inside a
 database transaction, running each spec inside its own savepoint inside that
 transaction, which can significantly speed up testing for specs that share
 expensive database setup code.
